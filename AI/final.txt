The original aim of this paper was to train a network to be able to do floating point calculations. But I have not been able to do that yet.

chaining inputs and outputs so that's it can handle digits greater than one byte. I haven't figured out how to do this yet.

sigmoid function dopeness. you have to do discrete calculus rather than normal calculus. It was easiest to implentmeant this as floating point, so for expediances sake I have not worked on this further.
