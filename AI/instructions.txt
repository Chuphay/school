to run the hello world program, type: 

>>>> gsi hello.scm

to simply use the scheme language, apparently 

>>>> gsi

should be just fine

once inside, try

>>>>> (+ 1 2)

On the other hand, prolog seems quite incomprehensible.

to run the hello world program, try:

>>>>> swipl hello.pl

and typing swipl will get you to the prompt as well... 

but i can't make heads or tails of it
