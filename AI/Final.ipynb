      "Graduate students are required to complete a research or design project in AI on a topic to be chosen in consultation with me. A written report on the project (minimum 2,500 words) and a brief oral presentation summarizing the same is expected at the end of the term. An ideal project should be one that demonstrates some creativity, attempts to answer some interesting research question(s), or offers an interesting AI solution to a problem of practical interest."

Floating point calculations by their natures truncate, or approxiamte their answers. On top of that, as we will see in this paper, most beginning applications of Artificial Neural networks concentrate on simple boolean functions, and I thought it would have been interesting to try and up the game a bit.
