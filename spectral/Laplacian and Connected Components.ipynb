    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, we are really only interested in connected graphs. Graphs that are disconnected can always be handled on the individually connected graphs. What that means is that we need a method to find out how many connected components are in a graph.\n",

    "$$L = \\left(\\begin{matrix} 1 \\ -1 \\\\ -1 ~~~~ \\ 1 \\end{matrix}\\right)$$\n",

    "What should be sort of clear is that all the information we need is contained in the first row of the matrix. From just the first row, we know that, node 1 is connected to node two. Looking at the second row just brings us redundant information. Now I am no expert on linear algebra, but I believe what this means is that, the matrix does not span the space and therefore does not have an inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a couple more examples to gain a little intuition about this. The next most easy graph, is the graph with 3 vertices and 2 edges connecting the three, the Laplacian is wtritten:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L = \\left(\\begin{matrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ ~~~~ 0 \\\\ -1 ~~~~ \\ 2 \\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\ -1 \\ ~~~~ 1 \\end{matrix}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we, can go through this row by row, to see what information we have. The first row tells us that node 1 and node 2 are connected. The second row tells us that, in addition to what we already know, node 2 is connected to node 3. And finally, the third row tells us that node 3 is connected to node 2, but again that is redundant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final example, let us consider an unconnected graph, with say 4 nodes, with an edge between node 1 and node 2 and an edge between node 3 and node 4. Here's the Laplacian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L = \\left(\\begin{matrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ ~~~~ 0 \\ ~~~~ 0 \\\\ -1 ~~~~ \\ 1 \\ ~~~~ 0 \\ ~~~~ 0 \\\\ 0 ~~~~ \\ 0 ~~~~ \\ 1\\ -1 \\\\ 0 ~~~~ \\ 0 ~~~~ \\ -1 \\ ~~~~ 1 \\end{matrix}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We again step through this row by row. The first row tells us that node 1 and node 2 are connected. The second row gives us redundant information. The third row tells us that node 3 and node 4. While the last row again yields no new insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that we now have a way to figure out how many connected components there are. We are looking for rows that give no additional insight. We can solve this easily by using Gaussian Elimination:"
